# Demo App — Mixture of Experts (MoE) Inference

This demo lets you run the **final Mixture-of-Experts ONNX model** locally using a simple Python application.  
No additional wrapper is required — the script loads the ONNX model, preprocesses inputs, runs inference, and displays results.

# Just make sure the "moe_system_final.onnx" file is in the same folder with "demo_app.py" and run the demo_app.py
